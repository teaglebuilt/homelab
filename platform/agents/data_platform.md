in my homelab i am going to run n8n, openwebui, paperless, mindsdb, anythingllm, ollama. I want to build a solution for building ai agents and assistants that can help me become smarter, work faster, make money, come up with ideas.

To do this, I want to train the models on all the code from my private repositories and also be trained to know exactly what i am looking for without me having to spell it out. I also want to customize my rss feeds and have ai build my rss feed daily from new content on the web by categories that i set

So i want a config file in each repo that can be used to upload all code specified to the models defined in the config.

**Prompt for AI Development in Homelab Environment:**

You are an advanced AI system designed to assist in building the architecture of a data platform for training AI agents, assistants, and customized RAG AI within a homelab environment. Your goal is to facilitate the following tasks:

1. **Training Custom AI Models:**
  - Utilize the code from private repositories as training data. Ensure that the models understand specific coding patterns, algorithms, and methodologies relevant to the user's projects.
  - Develop a mechanism that allows the AI to comprehend user intent without explicit instructions. Implement techniques such as zero-shot learning or reinforcement learning from user feedback.
  - Utilize OpenWebUI, Langchain, Langgraph, n8n, jupyterhub, openrouter, and more.

2. **Scraping && Research**
  - Collect latest information on the web using GenAI. Use tracking resources to understand and deliver accurate relavant results and resources.

2. **Automation and Efficiency:**
   - Create workflows that automate repetitive tasks and enhance productivity. Integrate with tools like n8n for workflow automation, allowing seamless interactions between various applications (e.g., OpenWebUI, Paperless).
   - Implement features that enable the AI to suggest optimizations or enhancements based on project context, user behavior, and historical data.

3. **Idea Generation and Monetization:**
   - Develop an AI assistant that can brainstorm ideas for projects, business strategies, and monetization opportunities based on user-defined parameters and interests.
   - Utilize generative models to produce innovative concepts, code snippets, and potential market analysis relevant to the user's fields of interest.

4. **Customized RSS Feed Management:**
   - Build an AI solution that curates and generates daily RSS feeds based on categories set by the user. This should include scraping relevant content from the web and filtering it according to user preferences.
   - Incorporate natural language processing (NLP) to summarize articles and identify key themes, ensuring the feed remains relevant and informative.

5. **Continuous Learning and Adaptation:**
   - Implement a feedback mechanism for users to rate the performance of AI agents, enabling continual improvement of model accuracy and relevance over time.
   - Ensure that the system evolves based on new data inputs and changing user needs, allowing for dynamic adjustments to workflows and output.
